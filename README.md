# C++ Utility Functions Project

## Overview
This C++ project demonstrates various utility functions using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It includes functionalities for:

- Random character and word generation
- Data encryption and decryption
- Array manipulation (filling, swapping, and shuffling)
- Input validation for numbers and dates

## Features
- Generate random characters, words, and keys
- Encrypt and decrypt text using a simple encryption key
- Swap values of different data types
- Validate numerical and date inputs
- Shuffle and fill arrays with random values

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ libraries

## Usage
Compile and run the program to see various utility functions in action.
